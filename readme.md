## CryptoPay – Cryptocurrency Payment Gateway Integration for Fluent Forms

### What does this plugin do?

As blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, more businesses and creators are looking for ways to accept digital currencies. If you're using Fluent Forms on your WordPress site and want to collect payments in crypto without relying on third-party processors, this plugin is for you.

CryptoPay allows you to easily integrate a decentralized, zero-commission cryptocurrency payment system directly into Fluent Forms.

### How does it work?

This plugin acts as an extension of the CryptoPay system, so you’ll need either the free (Lite) or paid (Premium) version of CryptoPay installed on your WordPress site. You’ll also need Fluent Forms active.

Once everything is set up, simply go to the payment settings in Fluent Forms and enable CryptoPay as a payment method. From there, you'll be able to accept cryptocurrency payments smoothly via your forms, as shown in the screenshots below.
